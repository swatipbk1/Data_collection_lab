 Data Collection Lab work
 Note (prob 3,4,5)-In order to keep the things simple, I chose to manually declare arrays on top of these question which is actually an array output of previous questions (a problem before them!).If you would replace these arrays with previous question output arrays, it is same and will produce the same result.
Note (porb 2)=My understanding as discussed with you in class, you wanted a array to be dynamically created and assigned by user.
To see the result of this question, you would have to input those values at run time.
e.g [["ID", "Name", "Occupation", "Age"],  ["42", "Bruce", "Knight", "41"],  ["57", "Bob", "Fry Cook", "19"],  ["63", "Blaine", "Quiz Master", "58"],  ["98", "Bill", "Doctor’s Assistant", "26"]]
Thank you!
